Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior has come out publicly to criticize Arsenal's warm-up routine, stating that it showed a lack of respect. This outburst has sparked a heated debate among fans and pundits alike.

### The Warm-Up Routine: A Sign of Disrespect?
According to Rosenior, Arsenal's warm-up routine was too close to the Chelsea bench, and the players were not giving the respect that they deserved.
