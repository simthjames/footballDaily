### The Rise of Big Game Betting Ads
The surge in big game betting ads has prompted the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to issue a warning on illegal sports betting in Washington. With the increasing popularity of sports betting, many companies are taking advantage of the trend to advertise their services. However, not all of these companies are operating legally, and the BBB is warning consumers to be cautious.

The big game betting ad surge has been fueled by the growing demand for online sports betting. Many states have legalized sports betting in recent years, and the industry has seen a significant increase in revenue. However, the rise of online sports betting has also led to an increase in illegal sports betting operations.

### The Dangers of Illegal Sports Betting
Illegal sports betting operations can pose a significant risk to consumers. These operations often do not provide the same level of protection as legal sports betting sites, and consumers may be at risk of losing their money or having their personal information stolen. Additionally, illegal sports betting operations can also lead to other forms of crime, such as money laundering and fraud.

The BBB is warning consumers to be cautious when engaging in sports betting, especially online. They recommend that consumers only use licensed and regulated sports betting sites, and to be wary of any site that promises unusually high returns or guarantees a win.
