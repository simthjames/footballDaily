### Return of the Reigning Champion
Bobby Portis, the veteran power forward, is set to make his return to the Milwaukee Bucks lineup. However, according to recent reports, Portis will not be starting in his first game back. This decision is likely a precautionary measure to ensure a smooth transition back into the team's rotation.

### Bench Boost
Despite not starting, Portis is expected to make a significant impact off the bench. His ability to score, rebound, and stretch the defense with his outside shooting will provide a much-needed boost to the Bucks' second unit. Portis has been an integral part of the team's success in recent years, and his return will undoubtedly be a welcome addition to the lineup.

However, it is essential to remember that his return will be a process, and it may take some time for him to regain his rhythm. As he works his way back into the lineup, the team will need to be patient and allow him to find his footing.

### Impact on the Team
Portis' return will have a significant impact on the team's overall performance. His presence will allow the Bucks to dictate matchups and create advantageous situations on the court.
