## Executive Summary: Manchester City's Mid-Season Conundrum
Manchester City, one of the top contenders for the Premier League title, has been struggling with a peculiar problem - a second-half slump. The team, led by Pep Guardiola, has been consistently starting games strong, only to lose control and complacency in the second half. This issue has resulted in dropped points and a narrowing of the gap between City and their title rivals.

## How Guardiola's Tactics Unravel in the Second Half
The Citizens have been known for their dominant and possession-based style of play, but their inability to maintain the same level of intensity and focus in the second half has raised concerns.

The question on everyone's mind is - can Guardiola find a solution to this problem and get his team back on track?
