### Shock Loss for Hull KR
Hull KR suffered a shocking loss to York Knights, and head coach Willie Peters was quick to point out the disappointing performance of half-back Mikey Lewis. According to Peters, Lewis 'let his team-mates down' during the match, which has raised concerns about the player's form and dedication to the team.

### Disappointing Performance
The loss to York Knights was a surprise to many, as Hull KR was expected to come out on top. However, the team's lackluster performance, particularly from Lewis, was a major factor in the defeat. Peters' comments suggest that Lewis failed to meet expectations, and his performance was not up to par.

### Under Pressure
As a key player for Hull KR, Lewis is under pressure to perform well and lead his team to victory. The criticism from Peters will likely add to the pressure, and Lewis will need to step up his game to regain the trust of his coach and teammates. The question on everyone's mind is, can Lewis bounce back from this criticism and lead Hull KR to success?

### Road to Recovery
For Hull KR to recover from this loss, the team will need to regroup and refocus. Peters will need to work with Lewis to identify areas for improvement and develop a plan to get him back on track. The team's upcoming matches will be crucial in determining their chances of success this season. With the right mindset and strategy, Hull KR can still achieve their goals, but it will require a collective effort from all players, including Lewis.

### Coach's Verdict
Peters' comments on Lewis' performance are a clear indication that the coach is not happy with the player's current form. The coach's verdict is simple: Lewis needs to improve, and fast. With the team's future success hanging in the balance, Lewis will need to take Peters' criticism on board and work tirelessly to regain his form.

### Fans' Reaction
The reaction from fans has been mixed, with some calling for Lewis to be dropped from the starting lineup. Others have come to his defense, arguing that one bad game does not define a player's entire season. The debate is ongoing, but one thing is certain: Lewis will need to prove himself in the upcoming matches to win back the support of the fans.
