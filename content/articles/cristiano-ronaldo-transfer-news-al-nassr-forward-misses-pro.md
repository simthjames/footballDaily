# Ronaldo's Strike Continues
Cristiano Ronaldo has missed his second consecutive Saudi Pro League game for Al Nassr as the club took on Al Ittihad. This comes amid reports of an ongoing strike by the Portuguese forward, who has been absent from the team's last two matches.

## Background to the Strike
The reasons behind Ronaldo's strike are not entirely clear, but it is believed to be related to issues with his contract or other personal matters. Despite being one of the highest-paid players in the world, Ronaldo has been rumored to be unhappy with certain aspects of his deal with Al Nassr.

### Impact on Al Nassr
Ronaldo's absence has been felt by Al Nassr, who have struggled to find the same level of success without their star player. The team has been unable to replicate the same level of performance that they had when Ronaldo was on the pitch, and his absence has been deeply felt.

## Possible Resolutions
There are several possible resolutions to the situation, including renegotiation of Ronaldo's contract or a potential transfer to another club. However, at this point, it is unclear what the future holds for the Portuguese forward.

### Transfer Speculation
Ronaldo's strike has led to speculation about his future with Al Nassr and potentially even a return to European football. Several top clubs have been linked with a move for the 38-year-old, but nothing has been confirmed at this point.

## Al Nassr's Response
Al Nassr has not commented publicly on Ronaldo's strike, but it is believed that the club is working to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. The team's manager has been forced to field questions about Ronaldo's absence, but has refused to speculate on the player's future.
