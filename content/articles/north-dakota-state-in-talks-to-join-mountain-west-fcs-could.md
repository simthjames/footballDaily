### A New Chapter Unfolds
North Dakota State, the reigning FCS powerhouse, is in serious discussions to join the Mountain West league for football in 2026. This move could mark a significant shift in the college football landscape, as the Bison would be leaving their current home in the Missouri Valley Football Conference.

The potential move is a testament to North Dakota State's dominance in the FCS, with the team having won nine national championships since 2011. The Mountain West league, which currently comprises 12 teams, would provide the Bison with a new challenge and increased exposure.

### Weighing the Options
The decision to join the Mountain West league is not without its considerations. North Dakota State would need to navigate the complexities of transitioning to a new conference, including scheduling, recruiting, and logistical arrangements. However, the potential benefits of joining a more prominent conference could outweigh the challenges, as the Bison would have the opportunity to compete against top-tier teams and increase their national profile.

### Impact on the FCS
The potential departure of North Dakota State from the FCS would have significant implications for the conference. The Bison have been a dominant force in the FCS, and their absence would create a power vacuum that other teams would need to fill. The move could also have a ripple effect on other FCS teams, as they may reassess their own conference affiliations and consider making a similar jump to the FBS.

### A New Era of Competition
If North Dakota State were to join the Mountain West league, it would create new and exciting matchups for college football fans. The Bison would face off against teams like Boise State, Fresno State, and San Diego State, providing a fresh set of challenges and opportunities for growth. The move would also increase the competitive balance in the Mountain West league, as North Dakota State would bring a high level of talent and dedication to the conference.
